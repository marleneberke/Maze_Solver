Start Date,End Date,Response Type,IP Address,Progress,Duration (in seconds),Finished,Recorded Date,Response ID,Recipient Last Name,Recipient First Name,Recipient Email,External Data Reference,Location Latitude,Location Longitude,Distribution Channel,User Language,"Informed Consent FormPurposeWe are conducting research on thinking. ProceduresThis experiment takes around 20 minutes to complete. You will watch a character solve a maze and answer questions about why you think they paused at different points along the maze. You will receive $4 upon completing the experiment. Risks and BenefitsCompleting this task poses no more risk of harm to you than do the experiences of everyday life (e.g., from working on a computer). Although this study will not benefit you personally, it will contribute to the advancement of our understanding of human reasoning.ConfidentialityAll of the responses you provide during this study will be anonymous. You will not be asked to provide any identifying information, such as your name, in any of the questionnaires. Typically, only the researchers involved in this study and those responsible for research oversight will have access to the information you provide. However, we may also share the data with other researchers so that they can check the accuracy of our conclusions; this will not impact you because the data are anonymous. The researcher will not know your name, and no identifying information will be connected to your survey answers in any way. The survey is therefore anonymous. However, your account is associated with a Prolific ID that the researcher has to be able to see in order to pay you, and in some cases these numbers are associated with public profiles which could, in theory, be searched. For this reason, though the researcher will not be looking at anyoneâ€™s public profiles, the fact of your participation in the research (as opposed to your actual survey responses) is technically considered confidential rather than truly anonymous. Voluntary Participation Your participation in this study is voluntary. You are free to decline to participate, to end your participation at any time for any reason, or to refuse to answer any individual question. QuestionsIf you have any questions about this study, you may contact Julian Jara-Ettinger at julian.jara-ettinger@yale.edu. If you would like to talk with someone other than the researchers to discuss problems or concerns, to discuss situations in the event that a member of the research team is not available, or to discuss your rights as a research participant, you may contact the Yale Human Subjects Committee below, and mention HSC number 2000020357:  Yale University Human Subjects Committee Box 208010, New Haven, CT 06520-8010 (203) 785-4688; human.subjects@yale.edu  Additional information is available  here  Agreement to participateBy clicking the button, you acknowledge that you have read the above information, and agree to participate in the study. You must be at least 18 years of age to participate; agreeing to participate confirms you are 18 years of age or older. Select the ""Yes"" option to confirm your agreement and continue.",Please enter your Prolific ID:,Select all of the possible reasons why someone might pause:,"You will use the slider to indicate how much of the pause was due to thinking or distractions. If you think they were thinking the whole time, move the slider all the way to the left. If you think they were distracted the whole time, move the slider all the way to the right. If you are unsure, leave it somewhere in the middle.

If you believe that the person was distracted for the whole pause, where would you put the slider? - Please adjust the slider to respond",Timing - First Click,Timing - Last Click,Timing - Page Submit,Timing - Click Count,"This video is giving you information that will help you in your task. Please watch this video carefully. In this video, the person solving the maze only ever pauses to think about the maze -- they never get distracted. This is what it looks like when a person solves the maze without any distraction.



Note: the top left is always the start of the maze, and the bottom right is always the end.
